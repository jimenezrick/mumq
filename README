  μMQ
=======

Very simple, small and fast STOMP message broker with in-memory
persistence written in Erlang.

μMQ supports a subset of STOMP 1.0: no transaction support, nor receipt
header and the acknowledge method is always `auto'.

The persistence works subscribing to any queue using the `id' header, if
the session is broken for any reason, the client can reconnect and
subscribe to the same queue using the previous `id' and it will received
the messages that were sent to the queue while he was not connected.

The queue names must have the format of an absolute UNIX path, like this:

        /foo
        /foo/bar
        /...

Any subscription will always suppose an implicit subscription to any
other existing queue with the same name prefix (i.e., specifying /foo,
you will be also subscribed to /foo/bar, /foo/bar/bur and so on).


 Install
---------

To compile μMQ simply run:

	make

To start an instance of the server for testing in the TCP port 61613,
just run:

	./start.sh

In order to create a target system for painless deployment, run:

	make release

This command will create the target system under rel/mumq/, copy it to
your desired destination and use the next helper script to control it:

	./rel/mumq/bin/mumq {start|stop|restart|console|...}

NOTE: the release handling seems to be broken in R15B, so better use any
      R14 release for creating the target system.
