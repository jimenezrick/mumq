  μMQ
=======

Very simple, small and fast STOMP message broker written in Erlang.


 Install
---------

To compile μMQ simply run:

	make

To start an instance of the server for testing in the TCP port 61613,
just run:

	./start.sh

In order to create a target system for painless deployment, run:

	make release

This command will create the target system under rel/mumq/, copy it to
your desired destination and use the next helper script to control it:

	./rel/mumq/bin/mumq {start|stop|restart|console|...}

NOTE: the release handling seems to be broken in R15B, so better use any
      R14 release for creating the target system.
